Starting the Bootstrap.....
Go the google and search the bootswatch theme...
I tried by opening every theme which looks nice.
So finally I decided to use the 'vapor' theme in my project.
Then I downloaded the bootstrap.css for that project to insert.
Then I go to the wwwroot folder then lib>bootstap>dist>css...
but the bootswatch.css file was already there. so I rename that file...
and insert the new bootstrap.css in that folder.

Then added the script and some css in the layout file.
Then go the _Layout.cshtml to the css file  name from bootstrap.min.css to bootstrap.css.
changed that...
Then do changes in the layout according to the css like bg-white to bg-primary and so on....
Removes the refrence from the layout...
